I'm a startup consultant, product manager, and operations strategist. I have worked with startups and Fortune 100 clients, and am currently launching a [consulting practice](/rhythm) focused on helping high-growth startups reimagine their operational workflow and hack their way to productivity.

I also serve as a mentor at General Assembly and am always working on a number of side projects. Please get in touch if you'd like to discuss a potential collaboration, or just toss around ideas over coffee!

#### My Background

I previously ran [General Assembly](http://ga.co/)'s WDI program, the world's largest web development bootcamp, which has helped thousands of students pursue work they love. Before that, I served as a consultant with [Deloitte](http://www.deloitte.com/us/consulting). I am a graduate of the [University of Maryland](http://www.umd.edu).
