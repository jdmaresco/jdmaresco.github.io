#### **I am a startup consultant, operations hacker, and code mentor.**

### About Me

I have built products, processes, and systems for startups and Fortune 500 clients. I advise and train high-growth startups on how to use code to improve their daily workflow and hack their way to productivity. I also serve as a mentor to new and aspiring web developers at General Assembly.

### My Background

I previously ran [General Assembly](http://ga.co/)'s WDI program, the world's largest web development bootcamp, which has helped thousands of students pursue work they love. Before that, I served as a consultant with [Deloitte](http://www.deloitte.com/us/consulting). I am a graduate of the [University of Maryland](http://www.umd.edu).
