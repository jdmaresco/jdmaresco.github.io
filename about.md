I work with [General Assembly](http://ga.co/), helping people pursue work they love through education in technology, business, and design. I helped launch the [Web Development Immersive](http://ga.co/wdi) in Washington DC and am now the Global Program Manager for WDI, working with our teams in 10 cities and 4 continents. 

I was previously with [Deloitte](http://www.deloitte.com/us/consulting). You can find me on [Twitter](www.twitter.com/jdmaresco) or [Github](www.github.com/jdmaresco).
