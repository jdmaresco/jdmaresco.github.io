I am a program producer at [General Assembly](http://ga.co/) and am launching a [Web Development Immersive](http://ga.co/wdi) program in Washington DC

I like to build things in code and am always trying to learn something new

You can find me on Twitter or Github by clicking the tiny links in the footer
