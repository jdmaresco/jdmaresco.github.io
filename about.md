I work with [General Assembly](http://ga.co/), helping people pursue work they love through education in technology, business, and design. I am the Product Manager for GA's [Web Development Immersive](http://ga.co/wdi) program.

I was previously a consultant with [Deloitte](http://www.deloitte.com/us/consulting) and am a proud [University of Maryland](http://www.umd.edu) alum. You can find me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/jdmaresco) or [Github](http://www.github.com/jdmaresco).
