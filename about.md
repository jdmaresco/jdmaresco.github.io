I am a program producer at [General Assembly](http://ga.co/) and am launching a [Web Development Immersive](http://ga.co/wdi) program in Washington DC. I was previously with [Deloitte Consulting](). 

I like to build things in code and am always trying to learn something new.

You can find me on [Twitter](www.twitter.com/jdmaresco) or [Github](www.github.com/jdmaresco).
