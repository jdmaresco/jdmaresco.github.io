excerpt: "When you send a message or check your news feed on your Facebook app, almost everything is routed through centralized servers. Your Instagram photos. Your email. Even your Snapchat messages (they say they're deleted... but are you really sure?) While most of us don't understand how all of this works, it's hard to miss the fact that centralized systems have major flaws, despite (or even because of) their growing complexity. The NSA can intercept your private user data from Google by tapping into their centralized network. Hackers can reveal millions of people's identities and online choices by hacking in through Ashley Madison's VPN. Apple iMessage goes down when Apple's servers go down. And 56 million credit cards can be stolen from one national retailer's servers, because, well...they were on a server."
